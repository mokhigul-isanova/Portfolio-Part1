<h1>JAMB exam score in Nigeria</h1>

<p>The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is standardized test measuring the
student-candidates’ knowledge and enabling them to enter the university level
conducted in Nigeria. This report will examine the JAMB scores of students in 2024 and
the factors influencing those scores.</p> <br>
<p>The aim of the report is identifying the problems affecting students’ test scores and
suggesting solutions to alleviate those issues. This research used various statistical
analysis methodologies including descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, regression
analysis and confidence interval. The statistical analysis compared the relationship
between students’ JAMB scores and different variables which might affect them.</p> <br>
<p>The research has identified several factors which could directly influence students’ academic performances in the test such as family background, having prior IT
knowledge, assignments completed, their attendance etc. Interestingly, the more time
students on test preparations has also impacted on better scores in the exam.</p><br>
<p>Additionally, the following problems were defined such as fewer study hours spent per
week, going to the public schools, attending far-distance schools, is inaccessibility to
study materials, lower socioeconomic status and not taking extra after-school
preparatory classes.</p><br>
<p>This study finishes suggesting solutions as follows: separating more time for test
preparation, improving IT skills, and doing more assigned tasks. To address the
following questions, various graphical visualizations including Pivot Table in Python, bar
graphs and relevant charts are created.</p><br>
